## In this file a description of the values required to run the 
## epigenomics pipeline is provided. 
## Please, provide all paths as absolute paths. $d/f.txt or ~/bin are ok.

# Root Directory.
## All analysis will be mounted on this location.
basedir=~/lustre/projects/brapa_spring19

## A copy of the scripts is expected at the base folder of each project.
## This directory indicates the location of auxiliary scripts.
# TEST. maybe try to get file dir otherwise.
scriptd="$basedir"/scripts/aux

# Metadata Information.
## A metadata file is required. The default format contains:
##   1st column. full_sample, names of the individual samples
##   2nd column. sample, names of strains/conditions that samples belong to
##   3rd column. rnaseq_R1, file names of forward PE reads
##   4th column. rnaseq_R2, file names of reverse PE reads
##   5th column. chipseq_R1, file names of forward PE reads
##   6th column. chipseq_R2, file names of reverse PE reads
##   7th column. batch, normalization batch for DESeq2
##   nth column. additional experiments can be added (rnaseq2)
##   mth column. extra conditions for DESeq2 may be added and edit the analysis

## Path to the metadata file.
metadata="$basedir"/mutant_list.csv

## Names of the experiments to be analyzed.
## These names must agree with those on runner scripts > 07.
exp=(chipseq rnaseq)

## Column positions of the forward read from each experiment.
## Read pairs must be on contiguous columns. [col=R1 col+1=R2]
declare -A expidx && expidx=([chipseq]=5 [rnaseq]=3)

## If some metadata columns are switched, indicate column position.
col_sample=1  # full_sample
col_strain=2  # sample
col_batch=7   # batch

## Indicate sample names of input ChIP and wild type.
## On this pipeline, only one input sample is considered.
input_name=input
wt_name=WT

# Genomic Resources.
## This epigenomics pipeline analyzes ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data by:
##   - Mapping to a reference genome.
##   - Counting RNA-Seq reads on gene models.
##   - Restricting the analysis to targeted genomic regions on ChIP-Seq.
##   - Measuring abundance of ChIP-Seq reads on normalized genomic features.
##   - Wrapping annotated and ready-to-analyze results.
## Thus, we need some information from you. Thanks.
# STILL UNFIXED
## on DESeq2, col_name of gene names in annot is "feature"
## on manorm.R, genome_annot header = TRUE and idcol = 1

## Paths to genomic resources.
genome_file=$STORE/UPM-CBGP/libraries/Bra_v3.0/Brapa_chiifu_v3.0.fasta
genome_gff=$STORE/UPM-CBGP/libraries/Bra_v3.0/Brapa_genome_v3.0_genes.gff3
genome_annot=$STORE/UPM-CBGP/libraries/Bra_v3.0/Bra_v3.0_annot_full.txt

## Path to a file containing a list of chromosomes/scaffolds to keep
## during filtering step of aligned ChIP-Seq data.
## Used by epic2 optimization to calculate genome coverage.
# TEST. What if left empty?
filterlist=$STORE/UPM-CBGP/libraries/Bra_v3.0/nuclear_scaff.txt

## Info for genome indexing: species tag, genome id and storage dir.
genome_sp=brapa
genome_id=Bra_v3.0
refdir=$STORE/reference/$genome_id

## Info for ChIP-Seq analysis tools. e.g. epic2, deeptools.
egf=0.9941        # effective genome fraction
peak_fc=0         # Min log2FC required on called peaks
epic2_gap=1       # Selected gap size of epic2 peaks for MAnorm
manorm_m=0        # Min log2FC (M) required on MAnorm results


# Software.
## Instructions to install most of the software are already included.
## So far code does not install and assumes modules.

## Path for software installations.
sw_dir=~/store/software

## Path to Anaconda3 installation. By default in software dir.
anaconda_dir=$sw_dir/anaconda3

## Add dir to PATH. Note that this script  is sourced multiple times,
## we recommend to modify PATH on ~/.bash_rc or do it manually.
# PATH=~/bin:$PATH


# Scripts.
## Values used on scripts. 
##   - Adapter file, required for trimming. Downloaded if absent.
##   - Gap size from epic2 optimization selected for MAnorm. Default 1.
##   - log2FC to filter results from epic2 and MAnorm. Default 0.
##   - If .sam files contain errors, maximum number of fixing attempts.
adapters_file=$sw_dir/Sequencing_adaptors.fasta
htseq_maxerr=3

## File endings at various steps. Recomended to leave as is.
## Maybe useful to match an external source.
## Note that most other files follow specified patterns.

sortbam_pt=.sort.bam
dup_pt=.dupmark.bam
